# PokéOrigins: Pokédex

Welcome to **PokéOrigins: Pokédex**, a web application that allows users to explore the world of Pokémon in an interactive and informative way. This app pulls data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to search and view detailed information about their favorite Pokémon.

## Features

- **Pokémon Search**: Easily search for any Pokémon by name or ID.
- **Detailed Information**: View detailed stats, abilities, moves, and other attributes of each Pokémon.
- **Pagination**: Browse through different pages of Pokémon with smooth navigation.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout for an optimized user experience on any device.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language for the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting for interactivity.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to run the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the server and handling requests.
- **PokéAPI**: A free and open API to retrieve Pokémon data.
